# Lists and Tuples

# List is another Data Type  example    Fruits = [ ]

#fruits = ["apple", "Pear", 3]   # 2 strings and 1 integer in this list
#print(fruits)  # prints  ["apple", "Pear", 3]

#fruits = ["apple", "Pear", 3]   # 2 strings and 1 integer in this list
#print(fruits[1]) #indices are created when you nake a list, starts with "0" so apple is indices 0, pear is indices 1, integer 3 is indices 3,   so "1" prints "pear"

#add to list

#fruits = ["apple", "Pear"]
#print(fruits)  #prints apple and pear
#fruits.append("strawberry") # adds strawberry to list
#print(fruits) # prints all three fruits "apple, pear, strawberry
#fruits.append("blueberry") # adds blueberry to the list
#print(fruits) # prints all four fruits "apple, pear, strawberry, blueberry"
##

#change something in list

#fruits = ["apple", "Pear", "strawberry"]
#fruits[1] = "blueberry"     #to change, you want to add square bracket and indices, for example we will use "pear" so "1" and "=" the fruit we want so "blueberry"
#print(fruits) #new print will be "apple, blueberry, strawberry"

#Tupil- another data type used for coordinates and rectangles and colors example below
#position = (2, 3)
#color = (255, 255, 255)
#print(type(color)) #prints <class 'tuple'>
