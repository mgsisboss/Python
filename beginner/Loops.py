#for x in range(0, 10, 1): #start, stop, step (is how much is added since it is "1" it will increase by "1:
#    print(x)   #prints 0-9 will not print 10 is not less than 10




for x in range(0, 10, 5): #start, stop, step (step is 5)
    print(x)   #prints "0, 5" because the step is "5". "0" would be first, "5" is second and since the next would be 10 it would not fit in range because 10 is not less than 10
